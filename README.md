# Titanic Dataset Analysis README

This repository has an in-depth exploration and analysis of the Titanic dataset. The dataset provides valuable information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic, including critical details such as their survival status, age, class, and various other attributes. This analysis is designed as an approachable introduction to data analysis using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this analysis is available in CSV format. It comprises the following essential columns:

- `PassengerId`: A unique identifier assigned to each passenger.
- `Survived`: A binary indicator, where 0 signifies that the passenger did not survive, and 1 indicates that they survived.
- `Pclass`: The passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- `Name`: The passenger's name.
- `Sex`: The gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: The passenger's age.
- `SibSp`: The count of siblings or spouses accompanying the passenger.
- `Parch`: The count of parents or children accompanying the passenger.
- `Ticket`: The passenger's ticket number.
- `Fare`: The fare paid by the passenger.
- `Cabin`: The cabin number.
- `Embarked`: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Analysis

Within this repository, you will find Jupyter notebook that guide you through a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset. The analysis encompasses the following things:
1. Determine if the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger
2. Determine if the survival rate is associated to the gender
3. Determine the survival rate is associated to the age



## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are utilized in this analysis:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
